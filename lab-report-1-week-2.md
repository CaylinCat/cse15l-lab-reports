    Hint: it should look something like **cs15lwi22aa5@ieng6.ucsd.edu** though possibly not exactly
3. Go to your terminal and type the following command! Remember to replace **your_account** with your own account.

```
$ ssh your_account
```
4. You will probably have to say yes to a bunch of questions, but after that you are done and connected.
